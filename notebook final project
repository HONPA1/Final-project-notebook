## Arithmetic expression examples  
### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
- Add: \(10 + 6 = 16\)
- Sub: \(25 - 5 = 20\)
# Multiplying and adding numbers  
X = 6
Y = 6
Z = (X * Y) + (X + Y)
Z
# Converting minutes to hours
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
***Objectives***
- Learn about the tools and libraries used in Data Science.
- Understand the basic arithmetic operations.
